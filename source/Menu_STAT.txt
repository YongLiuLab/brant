STAT
===================================

The current module provides Student's t-tests for sample mean comparisons and several methods for image-based meta-analysis (IBMA). For multi-comparison correction, we use the Benjamini-Hochberg and the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedures to control the false discovery rate (FDR) of dependent and independent cases, and the Bonferroni procedure to control the familywise error rate (FWER).
