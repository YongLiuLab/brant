AM
----------------------------------------

AM is calculated as the average amplitude and the standard deviation of the mean-subtracted time series. The AM represents the strength of time series' temporal fluctuation, which is similar to ALFF/fALFF.

* **mask**: could be whole brain mask or gray matter mask.
* **id index**: identifier to find unique string for each subject
* **filetype**: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
* **4D nifti files**: if the input data is 4D, check this item. Otherwise uncheck.
* **input dirs**: directories can be input either using a :file:`\*.txt` file or spm select window. 
* **time series**: choose the time series to calculate, seperated by ','.

* **mean temporal ampilitude**: calculate absolute value of detrended and demeaned time series.

* **standard deviation**: calculate standard deviation of time series
* **variation**: calculate variation of time series   
* **normalize transform**: in output file, a suffix of *_m* means the output is divided by mean intensity in the mask; a suffix of *_z* means the output is subtracted by mean intensity and divided by standard deviation.
* **out dir**: output directory for saving results.
- **Buttons**:
   - **S**: Save parameters of the current panel to a :file:`\*.mat` file. The :file:`\*.mat` can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
   - **L**: Load parameters from :file:`\*.mat` for the current panel.
   - **?**: Help information.
