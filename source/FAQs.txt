==============================
How can I Download and Install BRANT
-------------------------------------
* You can get latest version of BRANT from
    https://github.com/kbxu/brant/archive/master.zip
	
* Some functions are based on SPM, you can get it from
    http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm12_updates
	
* Circos in STEP 8 can be downloaded from
    http://circos.ca/distribution/circos-0.69-5.tgz
	
* Unzip the *brant-master.zip* file. Move the brant folder and spm12 folder to *\*/Matlab/toolbox*.

* Open Matlab, use *Set Path* and add folders above with their subfolders. You can also print *brant_configure_paths* in matlab to config BRANT.

How to Format Tables Correctly
---------------------------------------
* In some fictions, you may have to use some *.csv* files to input data. If you cannot find any proper existed *.csv* files, you can create a *.csv* file by Excel or Notepad. e.g.

    * STEP 4 => FC => Draw ROI => Coordinates in txt or csv file (input type: file)
	=== === === ========
	x   y   z   label
	=== === === ========
	40  -16 50  ROI1
	-40 -16 50  ROI2
	=== === === ========
	
	
    * STEP 6 => STAT => T-Tests => table
	================ ====== === ====
	name             group  age sex
	================ ====== === ====
	NC_02_0001_fMRI  grp1   31  0
	NC_02_0002_fMRI  grp2   27  0
	NC_02_0003_fMRI  grp1   36  0
	NC_02_0004_fMRI  grp2   37  1
	================ ====== === ====
	
	
    * STEP 8 => VIEW => Network Visualization => node
	======= ======= ======= ======= ======= ======
	x       y       z       label   vox_num index
	======= ======= ======= ======= ======= ======
	-4.6213 15.6    53.2468 A8m_l   235     1
	...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
	======= ======= ======= ======= ======= ======
	
	
	This *brant_roi_info.csv* file can be found in the folder as the *out dir* of *ROI Calculation* in `STEP 4`_.
	
	
    * STEP 8 => Embedded => Circos => roi info
	======== ======= ======== =========== ======= ======== ======= ======= ============= ===========
	x        y       z        label_old   label   vox_num  index   module  index_module  index_node

	This *brant_circos_3mm_273.csv* file can be found in the *\*/Matlab/toolbox/brant-master/circos*.

What can I Do When an Error Occurs
-------------------------------------
* Here are some common errors with their reasons and solutions below. You can also modify parameters with the help of `examples`_ and rerun former steps. If these all cannot work, please contact us.


1.

   fig.1 error during DICOM Convert
   
* Reason: Misuse id index. 
* Solution: Delete files created before the error occurs. Read `example`_ to use id index properly.

   fig.2 error after preprocessing
   
* Reason: The preprocessing may be interrupted and create wrong *.nii* files. 
* Solution: Delete files created during preprocessing, examine your preprocessing settings and run preprocessing again.

3.

.. figure:: _images/faqs_error_new_5.png
   :align: center
   
   fig.3 error during preprocessing
   
* Reason: TR(s) in Preprocessing is zero.
* Solution: Set tr(s) in *Silce Timing* to a legal value.

4.

.. figure:: _images/faqs_error_new_3.png
   :align: center
   
   fig.4 error during STAT
   
* Reason: The table file is incorrect.
* Solution: Confirm that the table file contains a row with group information and contains only one row. Open it with notepad to check if the data in this file is divided by comma. 

5. 

.. figure:: _images/faqs_error_new_4.png
   :align: center
   
   fig.5 error after DICOM Convert
   
* Reason: More than one *\*.nii* files were found in above directories.
* Solution: Uncheck the *delete first N timepoints* or convert just one set of data per time.
