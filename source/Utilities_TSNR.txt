TSNR (Temporal Signal to Noise Ratio)
---------------------------------------------------

Influenced by the magnetic field inhomogeneity at air-tissue interfaces, rs-fMRI signals at orbitofrontal and temporal medial and polar areas suffer from a certain degree of distortions and signal loss. To exclude spurious voxels, we use the thresholded voxel-wise TSNR, which is calculated as the average intensity of time series divided ty the standart deviation, to generate subject-level or group-leval whole-brain mask.

* **mask**: could be whole brain mask or gray matter mask.
* **id index**: identifier to find unique string for each subject
* **filetype**: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
* **4D nifti files**: if the input data is 4D, check this item. Otherwise uncheck.
* **input dirs**: directories can be input either using a :file:`\*.txt` file or spm select window.
* **threshold**: intensity threshold for mean TSNR (to generate a binary mask).
* **out dir**: output directory for saving results.
    
- **Buttons**:
    - **S**: Save parameters of the current panel to a :file:`\*.mat` file. The :file:`\*.mat` can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
    - **L**: Load parameters from :file:`\*.mat` for the current panel.
    - **?**: Help information.
