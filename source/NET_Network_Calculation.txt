* **parallel workers**: number of workers used for parallel computing.
* **filetype**: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
* **data dir**: directory where all *\*.txt* correlation matrix results are stored.
    
* **matrix type**:
    * **raw value**: use raw value to construct binary matrix.
    * **absolute value**: use absolute value to construct binary matrix.
	
* **intensity threshold**: vector of thresholds for matrix intensity. e.g. correlation coefficient
* **thresholds of sparsity**: a vector of sparsity threshold, for each element, threshold the input matrix using the fraction of the matrix's largest number of connection n*(n+1)/2;
    
* **minimum spanning tree**: a process to avoid unconnected network. To label the backbone of the network's nodes.
    
* **matrix type**: binarized and weighted network. The binarized networks comes from thresholded input matrics, while the weighted network comes from a dot product operation of binarized network and the original network.
* **Network properies**: a panel to select network properties. In the option panel, (*) means the calculation of the property is slow.
* **out dir**: output directory for saving results.
    
* **zero value in clustering coefficient**: if the network is connected in a way (e.g. Hamilton path) that neighbour nodes are not connected; or the current node has only one neighbour node.
* **Inf in small worldness**: The small-worldness is calculated as real-network / random-network, and in real and random case, small-worldness is calculated as clustering coefficient/shortest-path length. If the mean clustering coefficient of the random-network is zero, then the small-worldness of random-network is zero, and it will cause the real-network / random-network to be Inf(any non-zero divided by 0). The solution is set smaller thresholds that avaliable for all subjects.
    
- **Buttons**:
    - **S**: Save parameters of the current panel to a *\*.mat* file. The *\*.mat* can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
    - **L**: Load parameters from *\*.mat* for the current panel.
    - **?**: Help information.
