===================================

Functional connectivity is calculated as the temporal correlation between pairs of time series extracted from ROIs or voxels. 

In BRANT, three methods of preparing ROIs are provided, including drawing spheres/cubes from coordinates, extracting ROIs from an atlas and merging separate ROI files into one number-tagged template.
