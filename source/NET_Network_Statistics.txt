* **filetype**: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
* **data dir**: directory where *\*.mat* result of NETWORK CALCULATION is stored.
* **stat type**: one sample t-test, two sample t-test and paired t-test.
* **groups**:
    * for two sample t-test, e.g. SZ,NC -> will do two-sample t-test for SZ and NC
    * for paired t-test, e.g. SZ,NC -> will do paired t-test for SZ and NC
    * for one sample t-test, e.g. SZ;NC -> will do one-sample t-test for both SZ and NC group
    
* **grouping info**:
    * **table**: A comma-seperated values (csv) table, which is used for parsing subject names and covariates. The parsed names/ids will be matched to search results conducted with datadir and filetype. Before matching, BRANT will remove specified strings.
	
    * For one and two sample t-tests:
       ====== ======== ========== =======
       name   group    filter     age
       ====== ======== ========== =======
       subj1  SZ       center1    28
       subj2  SZ       center1    27
       subj3  NC       center1    30
       subj4  NC       center2    25
       ====== ======== ========== =======
	
    * For paired t-test, another column of paired_t_idx is required to specify paired subjects in each group:
       ====== ======== ========== ======= =============
       name   group    filter     age     paired_t_idx
       ====== ======== ========== ======= =============
       subj1  stage1   center1    28      1
       subj2  stage1   center1    27      2
       subj3  stage2   center1    30      1
       subj4  stage2   center2    25      2
       ====== ======== ========== ======= =============
        
* **string removal***: optional. remove partial string from string parsed by id index.
* **regressors***: optional. title of regressors which will be regressed out before statistical analysis. e.g. age
* **filter***: optional. use the control for subject in different state or center, fill in center1 here and subject4 won't be included in the analysis.
* **discard subjects without info**: when checked, if subjects' information are not found in the table, a warning message will be shown; when unchecked, an error message will be shown.    
* **out dir**: output directory for saving results.
    
* If the output figure is empty, check whether there is NaN or Inf in the output *\*.csv* files, where the raw global network properties are extracted.
	
- **Buttons**:
    - **S**: Save parameters of the current panel to a *\*.mat* file. The *\*.mat* can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
    - **L**: Load parameters from *\*.mat* for the current panel.
    - **?**: Help information.
